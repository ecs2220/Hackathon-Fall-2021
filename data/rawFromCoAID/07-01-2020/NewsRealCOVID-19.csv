speedup an end to the pandemic.since the act accelerator was launched the partner organizations have moved fast to develop costed and implementable plans designed to contribute to the end of the

including us$13.7 billion to cover immediate needs i.e. us$17.1 billion is immediately required of which us$3.4 billion has been pledged).the investment required is significant but it pales in significance when compared to the cost of covid-19 the total cost of the act accelerator 's work is less than a tenth of what the imf estimates the global economy is losing every month due to the pandemic. 468,000 thousand people have already lost their lives.the tools developed will benefit the whole world the act accelerator pillars will also buy and deliver tools to ensure that lmics have access.the act accelerators investment case is available here.act accelerator pillarsthe act accelerator is led by the work of partner organizations collaborating under four pillars.the diagnostics pillar is co led by find and the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria and aims to save 9 million lives and avoid 1.6 billion further infections through the power of equitable access to simple accurate and affordable tests. with sufficient funding it can bring to market 23 high quality rapid tests train 10,000 healthcare professionals across 50 countries and establish testing for 500 million people in low- and middle income countries. its success will be determined by how quickly test trace and isolate strategies can be put in place to minimize disruption of health services and prepare countries for the effective roll out of therapeutics and vaccines once available. the investment case is available here.the therapeutics pillar is led by unitaid and the wellcome trust on behalf of the covid-19 therapeutics accelerator and seeks to accelerate the development and equitable delivery of treatments at all stages of disease ensuring they are accessible to all regardless of geography and level of economic resource. it targets development manufacture procurement and equitable distribution of 245 million courses of treatment for populations in low and middle income countries within 12 months. the investment case is available here.the vaccine pillar combines cepis leadership in vaccine development and investment in manufacturing with gavis track record in revolutionizing access and delivery and who s oversight of regulation policy and allocation. its role is to ensure that vaccines are developed as rapidly as possible manufactured at the right volumes without compromising on safety and delivered to those that need them most. the current estimate to deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 assuming a safe and effective vaccine is developed in the near future is up to us$18.1 billion. in addition 950 million doses will need to be procured by self financing high income countries and upper middle income countries through the covax facility. these numbers will become clearer once we get a better idea of among other factors the technology that the successful vaccine candidates will be based on and the number of doses required to protect people from covid-19. the investment case is available here.the health systems connector is the fourth pillar of the act accelerator and supports the other three by ensuring that health systems and local community networks can fully utilize these and other essential tools in their battle against covid-19. this pillar is led by the world bank and the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria gfatm and supported by the who. it aims to build capacity such as laboratory capacity training for laboratory and health staff and management of protective equipment for health workers needed to deploy the new tools effectively when they are ready. it also works on system innovations to complement the rollout of products such as contact tracing social distancing and isolation approaches as well as community engagement needed to sustain them. global health security and the fight against covid-19 depends on shoring up health systems around the world now.call to actionsince its launch many governments and companies have signaled commitment to the act accelerator and made financial pledges. to date contributing countries have committed a total us$3.4. the funding gap is us$ 27.9 billion.on 27 june the global goal unite for our future campaign concert summit will be calling on citizens to tackle global injustices by using our collective voice to drive change for everyone

at risk of diseases like diphtheria measles and polio. this stark warning comes from the world health organization unicef and gavi the vaccine alliance ahead of the global vaccine summit on 4 june at which world leaders will come together to help maintain immunization programmes and mitigate the impact of the pandemic in lower income countries. according to data collected by the world health organization unicef gavi and the sabin vaccine institute provision of routine immunization services is substantially hindered in at least 68 countries and is likely to affect approximately 80 million children under the age of 1 living in these countries. routine immunization of children disrupted since march 2020 routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a global scale that may be unprecedented since the inception of expanded programs on immunization epi in the 1970s. more than half 53 of the 129 countries where data were available reported moderate to severe disruptions or a total suspension of vaccination services during march april 2020.immunization is one of the most powerful and fundamental disease prevention tools in the history of public health said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. disruption to immunization programmes from the covid-19 pandemic threatens to unwind decades of progress against vaccine preventable diseases like measles.at the 4 june global vaccine summit in london donors will pledge their support to gavi the vaccine alliance to sustain and accelerate this lifesaving work in some of the most vulnerable countries. from the bottom of my heart i urge donors to fully fund the alliance. these countries these children especially need vaccines and they need gavi.the reasons for disrupted services vary. some parents are reluctant to leave home because of restrictions on movement lack of information or because they fear infection with the covid-19 virus. and many health workers are unavailable because of restrictions on travel or redeployment to covid response duties as well as a lack of protective equipment.more children in more countries are now protected against more vaccine preventable diseases than at any point in history said dr. seth berkley gavi ceo. due to covid-19 this immense progress is now under threat risking the resurgence of diseases like measles and polio. not only will maintaining immunization programmes prevent more outbreaks it will also ensure we have the infrastructure we need to roll out an eventual covid-19 vaccine on a global scale.transport delays of vaccines are exacerbating the situation. unicef has reported a substantial delay in planned vaccine deliveries due to the lockdown measures and the ensuing decline in commercial flights and limited availability of charters. to help mitigate this unicef is appealing to governments the private sector the airline industry and others to free up freight space at an affordable cost for these life saving vaccines. gavi recently signed an agreement with unicef to provide advance funding to cover increased freight costs for delivery of vaccines in light of the reduced number of commercial flights available for transport.we can not let our fight against one disease come at the expense of long term progress in our fight against other diseases said henrietta fore unicef executive director. we have effective vaccines against measles polio and cholera. while circumstances may require us to temporarily pause some immunization efforts these immunizations must restart as soon as possible or we risk exchanging one deadly outbreak for another.next week who will issue new advice to countries on maintaining essential services during the pandemic including recommendations on how to provide immunizations safely.mass immunization campaigns temporarily disruptedmany countries have temporarily and justifiably suspended preventive mass vaccination campaigns against diseases like cholera measles meningitis polio tetanus typhoid and yellow fever due to risk of transmission and the need to maintain physical distancing during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic. measles and polio vaccination campaigns in particular have been badly hit with measles campaigns suspended in 27 countries and polio campaigns put on hold in 38 countries. at least 24 million people in 21 gavi supported lower income countries are at risk of missing out on vaccines against polio measles typhoid yellow fever cholera rotavirus hpv meningitis a and rubella due to postponed campaigns and introductions of new vaccines. in late march concerned that mass gatherings for vaccination campaigns would enflame transmission of covid-19 who recommended countries to temporarily suspend preventive campaigns while assessments of risk and effective measures for reducing covid virus transmission were established.who has since monitored the situation and has now issued advice to help countries determine how and when to resume mass vaccination campaigns. the guidance notes that countries will need to make specific risk assessments based on the local dynamics of covid-19 transmission the health system capacities and the public health benefit of conducting preventive and outbreak response vaccination campaigns. based on this guidance and following growing concerns about increasing transmission of polio the global polio eradication initiative gpei is advising countries to start planning for the safe resumption of polio vaccination campaigns especially in polio high risk countries.despite the challenges several countries are making special efforts to continue immunization. uganda is ensuring that immunization services continue along with other essential health services even funding transportation to ensure outreach activities. and in lao pdr despite a national lockdown imposed in march routine immunization in fixed sites continued with physical distancing measures in place.

highlighting the need to urgently increase investment in services for mental health or risk a massive increase in mental health conditions in the coming months according to a policy brief on covid-19 and mental health issued by the united nations today.the impact of the pandemic on peoples mental health is already extremely concerning said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general of the world health organization. social isolation fear of contagion and loss of family members is compounded by the distress caused by loss of income and often employment.depression and anxiety are increasingreports already indicate an increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety in a number of countries. a study in ethiopia in april 2020 reported a 3-fold increase in the prevalence of symptoms of depression compared to estimates from ethiopia before the epidemic.specific population groups are at particular risk of covid related psychological distress. frontline health care workers faced with heavy workloads life or death decisions and risk of infection are particularly affected. during the pandemic in china health care workers have reported high rates of depression 50 anxiety 45 and insomnia 34 and in canada 47 of health care workers have reported a need for psychological support.children and adolescents are also at risk. parents in italy and spain have reported that their children have had difficulties concentrating as well as irritability restlessness and nervousness. stay at home measures have come with a heightened risk of children witnessing or suffering violence and abuse. children with disabilities children in crowded settings and those who live and work on the streets are particularly vulnerable.other groups that are at particular risk are women particularly those who are juggling home schooling working from home and household tasks older persons and people with pre existing mental health conditions. a study carried out with young people with a history of mental health needs living in the uk reports that 32 of them agreed that the pandemic had made their mental health much worse.an increase in alcohol consumption is another area of concern for mental health experts. statistics from canada report that 20 of 15 49 year olds have increased their alcohol consumption during the pandemic.mental health services interruptedthe increase in people in need of mental health or psychosocial support has been compounded by the interruption to physical and mental health services in many countries. in addition to the conversion of mental health facilities into care facilities for people with covid-19 care systems have been affected by mental health staff being infected with the virus and the closing of face to face services. community services such as self help groups for alcohol and drug dependence have in many countries been unable to meet for several months.it is now crystal clear that mental health needs must be treated as a core element of our response to and recovery from the covid-19 pandemic said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus. this is a collective responsibility of governments and civil society with the support of the whole united nations system. a failure to take peoples emotional well being seriously will lead to long term social and economic costs to society.finding ways to provide servicesin concrete terms it is critical that people living with mental health conditions have continued access to treatment. changes in approaches to provision of mental health care and psychosocial support are showing signs of success in some countries. in madrid when more than 60 of mental health beds were converted to care for people with covid-19 where possible people with severe conditions were moved to private clinics to ensure continuity of care. local policy makers identified emergency psychiatry as an essential service to enable mental health care workers to continue outpatient services over the phone. home visits were organized for the most serious cases. teams from egypt kenya nepal malaysia and new zealand among others have reported creating increased capacity of emergency telephone lines for mental health to reach people in need.support for community actions that strengthen social cohesion and reduce loneliness particularly for the most vulnerable such as older people must continue. such support is required from government local authorities the private sector and members of the general public with initiatives such as provision of food parcels regular phone check ins with people living alone and organization of online activities for intellectual and cognitive stimulation.an opportunity to build back betterthe scaling up and reorganization of mental health services that is now needed on a global scale is an opportunity to build a mental health system that is fit for the future said dvora kestel director of the department of mental health and substance use at who. this means developing and funding national plans that shift care away from institutions to community services ensuring coverage for mental health conditions in health insurance packages and building the human resource capacity to deliver quality mental health and social care in the community. ,,""""""

health and progress towards global development goals highlighted in the 2020 world health statistics published by the world health organization who today.the good news is that people around the world are living longer and healthier lives. the bad news is the rate of progress is too slow to meet the sustainable development goals and will be further thrown off track by covid-19 said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director-general.the pandemic highlights the urgent need for all countries to invest in strong health systems and primary health care as the best defense against outbreaks like covid-19 and against the many other health threats that people around the world face every day. health systems and health security are two sides of the same coin.whos world health statistics an annual check up on the worlds health reports progress against a series of key health and health service indicators revealing some important lessons in terms of progress made towards the sustainable development goals and gaps to fill.life expectancy and healthy life expectancy have increased but unequally.the biggest gains were reported in low income countries which saw life expectancy rise 21 or 11 years between 2000 and 2016 compared with an increase of 4 or 3 years in higher income countries).one driver of progress in lower income countries was improved access to services to prevent and treat hiv malaria and tuberculosis as well as anumber of neglected tropical diseases such as guinea worm. another was better maternal and child healthcare which led to a halving of child mortality between 2000 and 2018.but in a number of areas progress has been stalling. immunization coverage has barely increased in recent years and there are fears that malaria gains may be reversed. and there is an overall shortage of services within and outside the health system to prevent and treat noncommunicable diseases ncds such as cancer diabetes heart and lung disease and stroke. in 2016 71 per cent of all deaths worldwide were attributable to ncds with the majority of the 15 million premature deaths 85 occurring in low and middle income countries.this uneven progress broadly mirrors inequalities in access to quality health services. only between one third and one half the worlds population was able to obtain essential health services in 2017. service coverage in low- and middle income countries remains well below coverage in wealthier ones as do health workforce densities. in more than 40 of all countries there are fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10 000 people. over 55 of countries have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10 000 people.the inability to pay for healthcare is another major challenge for many. on current trends who estimates that this year 2020 approximately 1 billion people almost 13 per cent of the global population will be spending at least 10 of their household budgets on health care. the majority of these people live in lower middle income countries.the covid-19 pandemic highlights the need to protect people from health emergencies as well as to promote universal health coverage and healthier populations to keep people from needing health services through multisecotral interventions like improving basic hygiene and sanitation said dr samira asma assistant director general at who.in 2017 more than half 55 of the global population was estimated to lack access to safely managed sanitation services and more than one quarter 29 lacked safely managed drinking water. in the same year two in five households globally 40 lacked basic handwashing facilities with soap and water in their home.the world health statistics also highlight the need for stronger data and health information systems. uneven capacities to collect and use accurate timely and comparable health statistics undermining countries ability to understand population health trends develop appropriate policies allocate resources and prioritize interventions.for almost a fifth of countries over half of the key indicators have no recent primary or direct underlying data another major challenge in enabling countries to prepare for prevent and respond to health emergencies such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. who is therefore supporting countries in strengthening surveillance and data and health information systems so they can measure their status and manage improvements.the message from this report is clear as the world battles the most serious pandemic in 100 years just a decade away from the sdg deadline we must act together to strengthen primary health care and focus on the most vulnerable among us in order to eliminate the gross inequalities that dictate who lives a long healthy life and who does nt added asma. we will only succeed in doing this by helping countries to improve their data and health information systems.note for editorsthe world health statistics have been compiled primarily from publications and databases produced and maintained by who or by united nations un groups of which who is a member such as the un interagency group for child mortality estimation. in addition some statistics have been
