solidarity as governments private sector civil society and international organizations committed support to access to covid-19 tools- act accelerator initiative launched by world health organization alongside international partners.today nearly us$1 billion in new financing has been committed to initiative worlds most comprehensive multilateral end to end solution to devastating covid-19 pandemic.the act accelerator which wasco launched bythe world health organization european commission france and bill melinda gates foundationjust five months ago needs additional us$35 billion to realize its goals of producing 2 billion vaccine doses 245 million treatments and 500 million tests. new commitments to initiative are welcome and will be leveraged to catalyze further funding to continue act accelerators groundbreaking work.most urgently act accelerator requires us$15 billion to support immediate capacity buildingfor research and development manufacturing procurement and delivery systemsby end of year.convening high level event at 75th session of un general assembly to urgently mobilize support for act accelerator secretary general antnio guterres commended on extraordinary international effort to address human crisis like no other in our lifetimes adding that more efforts must be made to further deepen remarkable progress so far.it is in every countrys national and economic self interest to work together to massively expand access to tests and treatments and to support vaccine as global public gooda peoples vaccine available and affordable for everyone everywhere.the act acceleratorincluding its covax facilityis vehicle to get us there. investing in act accelerator will accelerate every countrys own recovery said mr. guterres who co hosted event with united kingdoms foreign secretary dominic raab south africas health minister zweli mkhize and director general of world health organization dr. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus.unprecedented global collaborationthe act accelerator which was launched just five months ago is unprecedented global collaboration of worlds top international health organizations working together to accelerate development production and equitable delivery of covid-19 tests treatments and vaccines.we have duty to ensure vaccines treatments and tests for covid-19 are available to allstopping global spread of pandemic protects british people and will put humanity on road to recovery. collaboration through act accelerator is critical to promoting development production and access for all countries said uk foreign secretary dominic raab.the united kingdom recently committed up to 571 m approximately us$ 732 m for covax. this includes up to 500 m for gavi advanced market commitment for covid-19 covax amc vaccinesa financing instrument that incentivises vaccine manufacturers to produce sufficient covid-19 vaccines to ensure access for developing countries.today uk foreign secretary called for more support pledging that this 500 m commitment would include 1 is$ 1.29 in matched funding for every us$4 committed by others for up to 250 m approximately us$ 321m).germany canada and sweden have also made new commitments to covax amc of euro 100 million cad$ 220 million and us$ 10 million respectively. these are eligible for matching with todays uk matching commitment.science is giving us solutions in form of new tests therapeutics andhopefullya vaccine. but science and solutions will be ineffective without solidarity said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general.i am grateful for generous financial commitments made today but we still have significant funding gap to close. fully financing act accelerator will help to control pandemic restore confidence and stimulate global recovery. frankly this is not financial challenge its test of solidarity. this is moment for saying no to nationalism and yes to our shared humanity. because ultimately act accelerator is not delivering merely vaccines diagnostics and therapeutics. its delivering something far more importanthope.we must confront this health crisis as global challenge together in solidarity and cooperation with one another working toward global solution. we have to generate key tests treatments and vaccines that we all need and make sure they are distributed equitably to people who most need them regardless of where they live and whether their country is wealthy or not said south africas health ministerzweli mkhize adding that large parts of population especially in developing countries remain vulnerable and marginalized during this pandemic.todays event highlighted substantial results achieved by access to covid-19 tools accelerator initiative since its launch availability of 120 million affordable and high quality rapid tests for low- and middle income countries breakthrough in trials with and rapid rollout of dexamethasonethe only drug found to make significant difference to patient mortality creation of covax facility global mechanism to ensure equitable access to eventual covid-19 vaccines regardless of income -comprising 168 economies and largest and most diverse vaccine portfolio in world with nine candidate vaccines under evaluation eight of them in clinical trials.in another significant show of support coalition of 16 pharmaceutical companies and bill melinda gates foundation signed agreement to cooperate on vaccine manufacturing and to scale up production at unprecedented speed ensuring that approved vaccines are more broadly accessible and distributed as early as possible. bill gates co chair of bill melinda gates foundation said one thing i 've learned studying history of pandemics is that they create surprising dynamic when it comes to self interest and altruism. pandemics are rare cases where countrys instinct to help itself is tightly aligned with its instinct to help others. self interested thing and altruistic thingmaking sure poor nations have access to vaccinesare oneandthe same.a number of countries most recently united kingdom and canada are good models for what other wealthy nations should do. they have donated enough money for covax vaccine pillar of act accelerator to procure probably hundreds of millions of vaccine doses for poor countries. but more will be needed and i hope wealthy nations will continue to be generous.the world bank unveiled plans this week for significant financial commitment to support developing countries to purchase covid-19 vaccines as soon as they are available.world bank president david malpass said that once plans are ratified by stakeholders having up to us$ 12 billion available in finance will be game changer because once safe and effective vaccine is available it will allow people to resume their lives with confidence.investing in global recoverythe act accelerator investment case illustrates considerable economic benefits of collectively accelerating development and deployment of tools to rapidly reduce risk of severe covid-19 disease globally. prior to unga 2020 act accelerator has raised us$3 billion out of need of us$38 billion. more detail can be found in act accelerator investment case.the economic rationale for investing in approach that can accelerate end of covid-19 crisis remains clear.fully financing initiative to help shorten duration of crisis would pay back this investment in less than 36 hours once global mobility and trade alone are restored.notes to editorsthe access to covid-19 tools act accelerator is proven up and running global collaboration to accelerate development production and equitable access to covid-19 tests treatments and vaccines. it was set up in response to call from g20 leaders in march and launched by who european commission france and bill melinda gates foundation in april 2020.the act accelerator is not decision making body or new organization it works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organizations to end pandemic. it is framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around table with goal of ending pandemic as quickly as possible through accelerated development equitable allocation and scaled up delivery of tests treatments and vaccines thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and economies

results against covid-19. its members share commitment to ensure all people have access to all tools needed to defeat covid-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.the act accelerator comprises four pillars diagnostics therapeutics vaccines and health system strengthening.the diagnosticspillar co convened by global fund and find is focused on bringing to market 23 high quality rapid tests training 10 000 healthcare professionals across 50 countries and establishing testing for 500 million people in low and middle income countries by mid-2021.the therapeutics pillar is led by unitaid and wellcome trust. therapeutics can play role in all stages of covid-19 disease to prevent infection suppress symptoms and spread of infection to others treat or prevent symptoms as life saving treatment for severe symptoms and as treatment that can speed up recovery. aim in next 12 months is to develop manufacture and distribute 245 million treatments helping covid-19 sufferers to recover from disease.the vaccinespillar convened by cepi gavi and who is speeding up search for effective vaccine for all countries. at same time it is supporting building of manufacturing capabilities and buying supply ahead of time so that 2 billion doses can befairly distributed by end of 2021.the health systems connector pillar led by world bank and global fund is

foundation has executed separate volume guarantee agreements with rapid diagnostic test rdt producers abbott and sd biosensor. these two arrangements will make available to lmics 120 million antigen rapid diagnostic tests ag rdts priced at maximum of us$5 per unit over period of six months. these tests provide results in 1530 minutes rather than hours or days and will enable expansion of testing particularly in countries that do not have extensive laboratory facilities or trained health workers to implement molecular polymerase chain reaction or pcr tests.the tests developed by abbott and sd biosensor are highly portable reliable and easy to administer making testing possible in near person decentralized healthcare settings. both companies tests are faster and cheaper than laboratory based tests enabling countries to increase pace of testing tracing and treating people for covid-19 at point of care particularly in areas with under resourced health systems. number of other ag rdts are at various stages of development and assessment.to scale up ag rdts global fund today announced that it has made available initial us$50 million from its covid-19 response mechanism to enable countries to purchase at least 10 million of new rapid tests for lmics at guaranteed price with first orders expected to be placed this week through global funds pooled procurement mechanism.find and who are working together to accelerate appropriate use by supporting implementation research that will optimize ag rdt use in multiple lmics in line with who guidance. this includes provision of catalytic volumes of tests to understand how ag rdts can best fit into health systems.unitaid and africa cdc will combine resources to initiate roll out of these tests in up to 20 countries in africa starting in october 2020. this multi million dollar intervention currently undergoing final sign off by their boards is designed to engage multiple partners active in covid-19 response in these countries such as chai african society for laboratory medicine aslm and local organizations. this will bolster efforts by african unions partnership to accelerate covid-19 testing pact initiative launched in august 2020 to mobilize experts community workers supplies and other resources to minimize impact of pandemic on african continent by testing tracing and treating covid-19 cases in timely manner.testing is critical cornerstone of covid-19 response enabling countries to trace and contain virus now and to prepare for roll out of vaccines once available. effective testing strategies rely on portfolio of test types that can be used in different settings and situations. while molecular tests started to be rolled out within month of virus being sequenced these tests are mainly laboratory based relying on infrastructure and trained personnel to conduct them. rapid tests to detect presence of virus at point of care which are faster and cheaper are vital addition to testing arsenal needed to contain and fight covid-19.who guidance published on 11 september 2020 highlights value of these tests in areas where community transmission is widespread and where nucleic acid amplification based diagnostic naat testing is either unavailable or where test results are significantly delayed. as well as supporting test trace isolate strategies tests can help identify or confirm new outbreaks support outbreak investigations through screening monitor disease trends and potentially test asymptomatic contacts.the act accelerator diagnostics pillar is co convened by find and global fund working closely with who and over 30 global health expert partners to accelerate innovation and overcome technical financial and political obstacles to achieving equitable access to effective and timely testing. such unprecedented global collaboration has enabled development and deployment of first who eul approved ag rdt within eight months of first identification of virus. in comparison it took nearly five years to develop first rdt for hiv. several more antigen rdts for covid-19 are currently under who eul review. overall act accelerator diagnostic pillar aims to facilitate supply of 500 million tests to lmics within 12 months.these agreements are critical to fulfil key objective of act accelerator to ensure all countries regardless of income have fair access to new tests and tools to fight covid-19. exceptional speed with which ag rdt access package has been created demonstrates breadth of impact of act accelerator initiative and this and future achievements in testing will complement similar milestones anticipated to emerge from vaccines and therapeutics pillars.dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general of who said high quality rapid tests show us where virus is hiding which is key to quickly tracing and isolating contacts and breaking chains of transmission. tests are critical tool for governments as they look to reopen economies and ultimately save both lives and livelihoods.mark suzman chief executive officer of gates foundation said testing is essential tool in fight against covid-19. we are delighted to join partnership that will help ensure that latest high quality diagnostics do not just go to highest bidder but will be available at affordable price to worlds lower income countries. in addition all of actions announced today point to growing success of act accelerator in catalyzing global cooperation for fair and effective response to this global crisis.dr iain barton chief executive officer of chai said these agreements will help ensure that millions of people in low- and middle income countries have access to high quality rapid testing in villages and towns as well as cities. this has potential to revolutionize governments ability to respond to pandemic enabling quick diagnosis and response to contain localized virus outbreaks before they spread.andrea f. wainer executive vice president of abbotts rapid and molecular diagnostics businesses said abbott is pleased to bring our panbio covid-19 rapid antigen test and sympheos digital solution to people and health authorities in low- and middle income countries through this innovative partnership. we have long been committed to making sure our life changing technologies are affordable and accessible and for decades have been supporting many of these countries with our rapid tests for malaria hiv hepatitis and other deadly infectious diseases.hyo keun lee chief executive officer of sd biosensor said we sd biosensor are pleased to supply our standard q covid-19 rapid antigen tests for people who really need fast and accurate covid-19 diagnosis. through this partnership we will keep striving do our best to provide best quality of covid-19 antigen rapid kits for fighting covid-19.dr john nkengasong director of africa cdc said antigen tests are important complement to pcr testing and are crucial to expand testing capacity throughout africa. beauty of antigen testing is that it is fast and gives quick results. it will allow healthcare workers to quickly isolate cases and treat them while tracing their contacts to cut transmission chain.dr philippe duneton unitaids executive director a.i. said access to these point of care rapid tests with be game changer in fight against covid-19. we are working to support

child.protect progress rise refocus recover 2020 highlights that since every woman every child movement was launched 10 years ago spearheaded by united nations secretary general there has been remarkable progress in improving health of worlds women children and adolescents. for example under five deaths reached all time recorded low in 2019 and more than 1 billion children were vaccinated over past decade. coverage of immunization skilled birth attendant and access to safe drinking water reached over 80 per cent. maternal deaths declined by 35 per cent since 2000 with most significant declines occurring from 2010. estimated 25 million child marriages were also prevented over past decade.however conflict climate instability and covid-19 pandemic are putting health and well being of all children and adolescents at risk. covid-19 crisis in particular is exacerbating existing inequities with reported disruptions in essential health interventions disproportionately impacting most vulnerable women and children. at height of pandemic lockdowns schools were closed in 192 countries affecting 1.6 billion students. domestic violence and abuse of girls and women increased. poverty and hunger are also on rise.even before covid-19 pandemic child under age of five died every six seconds somewhere around world said henrietta fore unicef executive director. millions of children living in conflict zones and fragile settings face even greater hardship with onset of pandemic. we need to work collectively to meet immediate needs caused by pandemic while also strengthening health systems. only then can we protect and save lives.in 2019 5.2 million children under age of 5 and 1 million adolescents died of preventable causes. every 13 seconds newborn baby died. every hour 33 women did not survive childbirth and 33.000 girls day were forced into marriages usually to much older men. report examines deep rooted inequities which continue to deprive women children and adolescents of their rights noting birthplace as significant determinant of survival. in 2019 82 percent of under-5 deaths and 86 percent of maternal deaths were concentrated in sub saharan africa and south asia. nine in 10 paediatric hiv infections occurred in sub saharan africa. maternal newborn child and adolescent mortality rates were substantially higher in countries chronically affected by conflict.for too long health and rights of women children and adolescents have received insufficient attention and services have been inadequately resourced said former prime minister of new zealand and board chair of partnership for maternal newborn and child health helen clark. we call on all partners to work together to support governments to strengthen health systems and tackle inequities that constrain progress.the report calls upon global community to fight covid-19 while honoring and respecting commitments that can improve lives of women and children and not widen gap between promise and reality. covid-19 pandemic threatens to turn back clock on years of progress in reproductive maternal child and adolescent health. this is unacceptable said muhammad ali pate global director for health nutrition and population at world bank group and director global financing facility. gff partnership will double down on its efforts to engage with partners and countries and honor global commitment to ensure that all women adolescents and children can access quality affordable health care they need to survive and thrive.the past decade of progress to advance health of women children and adolescents must be protected from impact of pandemic and responses to it report says. rapid reversal of hard fought progress in womens childrens and adolescents health is real threat said ties boerma director of countdown to 2030 for reproductive maternal newborn child and adolescent health. as intensive tracking of covid-19 pandemic tells us timely local data are necessary to be able to target actions and prevent rising inequalities. global and country investments in local health information systems are much needed to guide response and protect progress. without intensified efforts to combat preventable child deaths 48 million children under age 5 could die between 2020 and 2030. almost half of these deaths will be newborns. report advocates for countries to continue investing in health of all women children and adolescents in all crises. ""as we respond to covid-19 and reimagine better future with sustained peace including at home we must repeat unequivocally that rights of women and girls are not negotiable. even in times of crisis especially in times of crisis their sexual and reproductive health and rights must be safeguarded at all costs said natalia kanem unfpa executive director.the report argues that every woman every child movement is more critical than ever as we step into sdg decade of action in midst of worst global health crisis of generation. momentum of movement must continue to champion multilaterialism to mobilize action across all sectors to safeguard tremendous investments and gains realized by commitments since its launch 10 years ago and to protect health and well being of every woman child and adolescent everywhere. ""there is no doubt that pandemic has set back global efforts to improve health and well being of women and children but that should only serve to strengthen our resolve said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. our joint action under every woman every child movement is more important than ever. we now must renew our commitment to healthier safer fairer and more sustainable world for women children and future generations.link to report microsite http://protect.everywomaneverychild.org link to who global strategy for womens children and adolescents health data portal https://www.who.int data maternal newborn child adolescent global strategy data.

12.5 million in 1990 according to new mortality estimates released by unicef world health organization who population division of united nations department of economic and social affairs and world bank group. since then however surveys by unicef and who reveal that covid-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to health services that threaten to undo decades of hard won progress. global community has come too far towards eliminating preventable child deaths to allow covid-19 pandemic to stop us in our tracks said henrietta fore unicef executive director. when children are denied access to health services because system is overrun and when women are afraid to give birth at hospital for fear of infection they too may become casualties of covid-19. without urgent investments to re start disrupted health systems and services millions of children under five especially newborns could die. over past 30 years health services to prevent or treat causes of child death such as preterm low birthweight complications during birth neonatal sepsis pneumonia diarrhea and malaria as well as vaccination have played large role in saving millions of lives. now countries worldwide are experiencing disruptions in child and maternal health services such as health checkups vaccinations and prenatal and post natal care due to resource constraints and general uneasiness with using health services due to fear of getting covid-19. unicef survey conducted over summer across 77 countries found that almost 68 per cent of countries reported at least some disruption in health checks for children and immunization services. in addition 63 per cent of countries reported disruptions in antenatal checkups and 59 per cent in post natal care. recent who survey based on responses from 105 countries revealed that 52 per cent of countries reported disruptions in health services for sick children and 51 per cent in services for management of malnutrition. health interventions such as these are critical for stopping preventable newborn and child deaths. for example women who receive care by professional midwives trained according to internationals standards are 16 per cent less likely to lose their baby and 24 per cent less likely to experience pre term birth according to who. fact that today more children live to see their first birthday than any time in history is true mark of what can be achieved when world puts health and well being at centre of our response said dr. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. now we must not let covid-19 pandemic turn back remarkable progress for our children and future generations. rather its time to use what we know works to save lives and keep investing in stronger resilient health systems. based on responses from countries that participated in unicef and who surveys most commonly cited reasons for health service disruptions included parents avoiding health centers for fear of infection transport restrictions suspension or closure of services and facilities fewer healthcare workers due to diversions or fear of infection due to shortages in personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves and greater financial difficulties. afghanistan bolivia cameroon central african republic libya madagascar pakistan sudan and yemen are among hardest hit countries. seven of nine countries had high child mortality rates of more than 50 deaths per 1000 live births among children under five in 2019. in afghanistan where 1 in 17 children died before reaching age 5 in 2019 ministry of health reported significant reduction in visits to health facilities. out of fear of contracting covid-19 virus families are de prioritizing pre- and post natal care adding to risk faced by pregnant women and newborn babies. even before covid-19 newborns were at highest risk of death. in 2019 newborn baby died every 13 seconds. moreover 47 per cent of all under five deaths occurred in neonatal period up from 40 per cent in 1990. with severe disruptions in essential health services newborn babies could be at much higher risk of dying. for example in cameroon where 1 out of every 38 newborns died in 2019 unicef survey reported estimated 75 per cent disruptions in services for essential newborn care antenatal check ups obstetric care and post natal care. in may initial modelling by johns hopkins university showed that almost 6.000 additional children could die per day due to disruptions due to covid-19. these reports and surveys highlight need for urgent action to restore and improve childbirth services and antenatal and postnatal care for mothers and babies including having skilled health workers to care for them at birth. working with parents to assuage their fears and reassure them is also important. covid-19 pandemic has put years of global progress to end preventable child deaths in serious jeopardy said muhammad ali pate global director for health nutrition and population at world bank. it is essential to protect life saving services which have been key to reducing child mortality. we will continue to work with governments and partners to reinforce healthcare systems to ensure mothers and children get services they need. new report demonstrates ongoing progress worldwide in reducing child mortality said john wilmoth director of population division of united nations department of economic and social affairs. while report highlights negative effects of covid-19 pandemic on interventions that are critical for childrens health it also

underfunding of mental health prior to pandemic countries were spending less than 2 per cent of their national health budgets on mental health and struggling to meet their populations needs.and pandemic is increasing demand for mental health services. bereavement isolation loss of income and fear are triggering mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones. many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use insomnia and anxiety. meanwhile covid-19 itself can lead to neurological and mental complications such as delirium agitation and stroke. people with pre

fundamental to overall health and well being said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general of world health organization. covid-19 has interrupted essential mental health services around world just when they re needed most. world leaders must move fast and decisively to invest more in life saving mental health programmes during pandemic and beyond. survey finds major disruptions to critical

changed due to covid-19 types of services that have been disrupted and how countries are adapting to overcome these challenges.countries reported widespread disruption of many kinds of critical mental health services over 60 reported disruptions to mental health services for vulnerable people including children and adolescents 72 older adults 70 and women requiring antenatal or postnatal services 61%).67 saw disruptions to counseling and psychotherapy 65 to critical harm reduction services and 45 to opioid agonist maintenance treatment for opioid dependence.more than third 35 reported disruptions to emergency interventions including those for people experiencing prolonged seizures severe substance use withdrawal syndromes and delirium often sign of serious underlying medical condition.30 reported disruptions to access for medications for mental neurological and substance use disorders.around three quarters reported at least partial disruptions to school and workplace mental health services 78 and 75 respectively).while many countries 70 have adopted telemedicine or teletherapy to overcome disruptions to in person services there are significant disparities in uptake of these interventions. more than 80 of high income countries reported deploying telemedicine and teletherapy to bridge gaps in mental health compared with less than 50 of low income countries.who has issued guidance to countries on how to maintain essential services including mental health services during covid-19 and recommends that countries allocate resources to mental health as integral component of their response and recovery plans. organization also urges countries to monitor changes and disruptions in services so that they can address them as required.although 89 of countries reported in survey that mental health and psychosocial support is part of their national covid-19 response plans only 17 of these countries have full additional funding for covering these activities.this all highlights need for more money for mental health. as pandemic continues even greater demand will be placed on national and international mental health programmes that have suffered from years of chronic underfunding. spending 2 of national health budgets on mental health is not enough. international funders also need to do more mental health still receives less than 1 of

Guirao et al. Molecular Immunology, • IL-6 serum concentrations above 35 pg/mL were associated with a higher risk of (Figure): o More severe pneumonia (OR = 4.47, 95% CI 1.15-17.45, p = 0.031). o Increased risk of mortality (OR = 20.00, 95% CI 4.21-94.91, p = 0.0001). o ICU admission (OR = 12.75, 95% CI 2.16-75.33, p = 0.005). • Of the 27 patients treated with tocilizumab, 8 (28%) died, while 6 (26%) of the 23 patients who were not treated with tocilizumab died., Effect of tocilizumab vs usual care in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and moderate or severe pneumonia: A randomized clinical trial. Hermine et al. JAMA Internal Medicine, • Patients receiving tocilizumab had similar scores to the usual care [UC] group on the World Health Organization 10-point Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) on day 4 (Figure). o 12 of 63 (19%) patients randomized to receive tocilizumab had a WHO-CPS score higher than 5 vs 19 of 667 (28%) in the UC group (absolute difference -9%, 90% credible interval -21.0-3.1). • On day 14, the proportion of patients with noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation (MV) or death was lower in the tocilizumab group: 24% (95% CI 13%-35%) compared with 36% (95% CI 33%-58%) in the UC group. • No difference in mortality over 28 days was found between the two groups., Association between early treatment with tocilizumab and mortality among critically ill patients with COVID-19. Gupta et al. JAMA Internal Medicine, • Patients treated within 2 days of ICU admission with tocilizumab (n = 433) had a lower risk of death compared with those not treated with tocilizumab (n = 3, 491) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.56-0.92) (Figure). o 125 (28.9%) of patients treated with tocilizumab and 1, 419 (40.6%) of patients not treated with tocilizumab died. o The estimated 30-day mortality was 27.5% (95% CI 21.2%-33.8%) in the tocilizumab-treated patients and 37.1% (95% CI 35.5%-38.7%) in the non-tocilizumab-treated patients (risk difference, 9.6%, 95% CI 3.1%-16.0%). • Compared to patients who did not receive tocilizumab, tocilizumab-treated patients: o Were younger (median age, 58 vs 63 years). o Had fewer comorbidities (hypertension, 54.0% vs 62.6%, coronary artery disease, 9.0% vs 14.4%, or congestive heart failure, 5.3% vs 11.1%). o Were more likely to have severe hypoxemia (47.3% vs 37.9%). o Were more likely to receive corticosteroids on ICU admission (18.7% vs 12.6%)., Efficacy of tocilizumab in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Omer et al. JAMA Insights, • Highly communicable pathogens have a large reproductive number (R0); therefore, a greater proportion of the population must be immune to decrease sustained transmission and achieve herd immunity (Figure). • Herd immunity threshold (~60% for SARS-CoV-2) in the US without vaccination would require 198 million infections (Figure). o With a 0.5% fatality rate, up to 1 million deaths could result. • Currently, it is estimated that &lt;10% of the population has been infected based on antibody testing. o There is little precedent for achieving herd immunity without vaccination. o While a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could help achieve herd immunity, effectiveness and potential coverage of a future vaccine are not yet known., Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in children aged 0 to 19 years in childcare facilities and schools after their reopening in May 2020, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Ehrhardt et al. Eurosurveillance, • Child-to-child transmission in schools and childcare facilities was not common and was not the primary cause of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. • 137 (30%) of 453 COVID-19 cases among children 0–9 years of age attended school or childcare settings for at least 1 day in their infectious period, 316 (70%) were at home during their entire infectious period. o 6/137 (4.4%) infected a total of 11 additional students, no secondary infections were detected for the remaining cases. o Four students were infected by two teachers. o All remaining cases (n = 437) were infected by sources outside of school and childcare facilities (Figure). • Infection prevention and control measures were not uniformly implemented in childcare facilities and schools., Modeling COVID-19 scenarios for the United States.

Beaudoin-Bussières et al. mBio, • Levels of spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies in convalescent plasma (CP) significantly decreased from baseline (median 6 weeks after onset of symptoms) to 1-month follow-up (p &lt;0.0001) (Figure). o The proportion of individuals with detectable anti-RBD IgM and IgA decreased from baseline to 1 month by 13% and 25%, respectively. • 96.8% of CP had antibody that bound to both SARS-CoV-2 RBD forms at baseline and 1 month. o The levels of antibodies binding to both forms decreased from baseline to 1 month. • Neutralizing activity against both SARS-CoV-2 forms was detected in 71% of CP at baseline; the proportion decreased at 1 month to 41.9% (VSV-G) and 51.6% (D614G). o Level of neutralizing activity also decreased from baseline to 1 month (p &lt;0.0001 for both forms)., Waning antibody responses in asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Choe et al. Emerging Infectious Diseases, • Antibody titers correlated with disease severity. o The geometric mean titer was 105 among asymptomatic persons, 161 among patients with subtle pneumonia, and 891 among patients with apparent pneumonia. o The geometric mean titer of neutralizing antibodies declined from 219.4 at 2 months after infection to 143.7 at 5 months after infection. • 71% of asymptomatic patients had detectable antibodies at 2 months after infection which declined to 57% at 5 months after infection. • 100% of patients with pneumonia had detectable antibodies at 2 months after infection. o At 5 months, 83% of patients with subtle pneumonia and 100% of patients with apparent pneumonia had detectable antibodies., COVID-19, Science"""

doubling the contact tracing rate; reducing re-opening by 25% (Figure)., • 28% of children were admitted to the critical care unit. • 70% of children with comorbidities required critical care vs 37% of those without comorbidities (p = 0.008). o Obesity was the most common factor associated with critical care, 63% of obese vs 28% of non-obese children (p = 0.02). o 43% of children presenting with renal dysfunction vs 10% without renal dysfunction required critical care (p = 0.002). • A greater proportion of children with asthma, 28%, than those without, 8% (p = 0.002) received any respiratory support, with no difference in need for critical care (p = 0.26)., • At baseline, 10% of patients were anosmic (loss of sense of smell) and more than 50% were hyposmic (decreased sense of smell). • On follow-up, olfactory deficits improved in most patients (Figure). o Olfactory threshold (lowest concentration of an odor that could be detected) improved almost 2-fold, with less improvement in odor discrimination (ability to detect differences between odors). o No improvement was observed in odor identification (ability to correctly identify an odor). o By two months after symptom onset, there was a decrease in the number of hyposmic patients (53.3% to 6.7%), and an increase in normosmic patients (36.7% to 73.3%). o No patients remained anosmic., • Incidence of cerebrovascular events (CVE) was 1.13% or 1, 130 per 100, 000 (95% CI 970-1, 320 per 100, 000). o Incidence of acute ischemic stroke (1.08%) was greater than either intracranial hemorrhage (0.19%) or cortical vein and/or sinus thrombosis (0.02%). • In-hospital mortality for stroke and intracranial hemorrhage was 38.1% and 58.3%, respectively. • Median time from onset of CVE to death was ~4 days in persons with acute ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage., • Overall 28-day mortality was 12%; 39% if ventilated at randomization, 10% otherwise. • The risk of death for each drug vs standard of care was (Figure): o Remdesivir (rate ratio [RR] = 0.95, 95% CI 0.81-1.11, p = 0.50). o Hydroxychloroquine (RR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.89-1.59, p = 0.23). o Lopinavir plus ritonavir (RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.79-1.25, p = 0.97). o Interferon (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.96-1.39, p = 0.11). • Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir were discontinued for futility (unlikely to show a benefit). • No drug reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration., • Most mothers had either asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 (n = 54, 88.5%) while 11.5% (n = 7) had severe infection.  • A composite of adverse maternal outcomes was more likely among mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those without SARS-CoV-2 infection, 18.0% vs 8.2% (adjusted OR [aOR] 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-13.4). o Adverse maternal outcomes were similar among mothers with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 and those without SARS-CoV-2 infection, 7.4% vs 8.2% (aOR 1.1, 95% CI &lt;0.0-6.0).  o 100% of mothers with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections had adverse maternal outcomes compared with mothers without SARS-CoV-2 infection (8.2%).  • Adverse neonatal outcomes were similar among neonates born to mothers with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 vs those born to mothers without SARS-CoV-2 infection, 9.3% vs 13.9% (aOR 1.0, 95% CI 0.1-7.7). o Adverse neonatal outcomes were more prevalent among those born to mothers with severe COVID-19 (85.7%) than among those born to mothers without SARS-CoV-2 infection (13.9%)., • 2% (95% CI 0.2%-7.0%) of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. o None showed clinical signs of COVID-19. • No evidence of vertical or postnatal transmission in neonates who roomed with their mothers or who were breastfed. • Neonates born to mothers with severe COVID-19 were more likely than those born to mothers with asymptomatic or mild infection to be born earlier, median gestational age 37.9 vs 39.1 weeks (p = 0.02) and to require phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia, 30.0% vs 7.0% (p = 0.04)., • Diabetes was associated with increased risk of death (hazard ratio 2.32, 95% CI 1.44-3.75, p = 0.001) (Figure). There were negligible differences in SARS-CoV-2 humoral response in patients with and without diabetes (Figure). o Immune response was not influenced by glucose levels., Presence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain of the spike protein was predictive of survival in patients with and without diabetes., breastfed, COVID-19, Science"""

International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, • The three most common protective behaviors taken were washing hands (94.7%), keeping 6 feet away from persons outside the household (90.1%), and wearing a face mask (86.2%). • Persons with a close friend or family member who died of COVID-19 were more likely to have taken protective measures than those who did not: adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) in April = 1.04 (95% CI 1.00-1.08); May = 1.02 (95% CI 0.99-1.06); June = 1.16 (95% CI 1.11-1.20). • Females, persons of non-White race, persons living in larger households, older adults, and persons with comorbidities took more protective measures., Prevalence of depression symptoms in US adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ettman et al. JAMA, • During the COVID-19 pandemic period (March-April), depression symptoms were reported three times more often across all demographic groups than during a comparison pre-pandemic period (Figure 1). o 27.8% of persons had depression symptoms during the pandemic period, compared with 8.5% who had symptoms before the pandemic. o Severity of depression symptoms was also greater during the pandemic period compared with before (Figure 2). • Lower income, &lt;$5, 000 in savings, or experiencing COVID-19-related stressors (e.g., losing a job, knowing someone who died of COVID-19, having financial problems) were all associated with increased depression., A serological survey of SARS-CoV-2 in cats in Wuhan. Zhang et al. Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections, • A serological survey of cats found that 15/102 (14.7%) had antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2, and 11/102 (10.8%) had neutralizing antibodies (Figure). o None of the 15 positive samples cross-reacted with type I or II feline infectious peritonitis virus, a feline coronavirus. o Samples from 39 cats collected in 2019 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. • The three cats with the highest antibody levels to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) lived with individuals with COVID-19; neutralizing antibodies were found in 2 of the 3 cats. • Two cats whose owners were positive for COVID-19 had antibody levels that decreased to undetectable levels by 110 days after sampling began, a similar pattern was seen for neutralizing antibodies., Acute arterial thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 in the New York City area. Etkin et al. Annals of Vascular Surgery, • 49 COVID-19 patients had arterial thromboembolism diagnosed during hospitalization (median age 67 years [IQR 58-75]). o 22 (45%) COVID-19 patients had acute arterial ischemia on presentation and were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. o The most common preexisting conditions were hypertension (53%) and diabetes (35%); 18% were current or former smokers. • 21 (46%) patients died in the hospital. o Mortality in 35 patients with lower limb ischemia was 50% and in 2 patients with mesenteric ischemia was 100%. • 9 (18%) patients experienced limb loss., A SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate would likely match all currently circulating variants. Dearlove et al. Proceeding of National Academy of Sciences, • An analysis of 18, 514 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences observed limited viral diversity. o 7, 559 polymorphisms were detected (Figure). o 95% of sequences had 11 mutations or fewer. • The D614G mutation (found in 69.4% of sequences) in the spike (S) protein became dominant due to its presence in the early European cases (i.e., a founder effect), rather than adaption to host responses. o The D614G mutation was not predicted to interfere with vaccine-induced antibody binding., COVID-19, Science"""
